## Planner Gate Evidence

Status: PASS

- Manifest entrypoint created at this file.
- `work-pack/waves/W0.md` created with explicit dependency-direction and boundary exit gates.
- `work-pack/tasks/` created with mutation-capable planning tasks and seeded closure tasks.
- `Pipeline Stage Coverage` includes all canonical stages with wave mapping and status.
- `Architecture-Guided Task Directives` includes one row per mutation-capable task with exact coverage IDs and architecture links.
- Evolution Engine refresh added [PRODUCT-VIEW.md](PRODUCT-VIEW.md), [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md), [EVOLUTION-ARCHITECTURE.md](EVOLUTION-ARCHITECTURE.md), and [IMPLEMENTATION-LAYERING.md](IMPLEMENTATION-LAYERING.md).
- Runtime layers are separated into MVP Explore/Exploit plus identity/DNA confirmation, L1 evolution observability hardening, L2 proof-promotion enforcement, and L3 governed promotion pilot tasks.

## Mode Resolution

- Requested mode: `native`
- Delegation mode selected: `native`
- Determinism: non-interactive planning execution using existing feature docs and locked decisions

## Discovery Path Selection

Score formula:

`score = (1 - signal) * 0.45 + cost * 0.30 + ambiguity * 0.25`

| Path                     | Signal | Cost | Ambiguity | Score  |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ---- | --------- | ------ |
| links-tags-first         | 0.88   | 0.25 | 0.20      | 0.1790 |
| broad-search-first       | 0.74   | 0.60 | 0.35      | 0.3845 |
| focused-researcher-first | 0.82   | 0.50 | 0.30      | 0.3060 |
| capability-graph-first   | 0.79   | 0.42 | 0.24      | 0.2805 |

Selected path: `links-tags-first` (lowest score).

## UI Detection Gate

- HTTP endpoints in `interfaces.md`: yes
- `docs/UI-ARCHITECTURE.md`: present
- `docs/features/ui-prototyping-studio/UI-SPEC.md`: present
- Gate result: execute split flow through vertical capability slices (`TASK-UPS-WP-01/02/03`) and keep `ui-pipeline` stage as `skipped` because UI delivery is embedded in slice tasks.

Rules:

- If a targeted command reports no matched tests, treat the checkpoint as failed and BLOCK wave progression until coverage exists.
- Every mutation slice ends only after all listed after-slice commands pass.
- Every capability slice is incomplete until its prototype proof artifact exists and passes the acceptance script in the task file.
- Persist raw outputs per checkpoint under `docs/features/ui-prototyping-studio/work-pack/evidence/<TASK-ID>/<CHECKPOINT-ID>.log`.

## Blockers

No blocker-level unresolved decisions in MVP scope.

## Notes

- Feature implementation for MVP slices UPS-WP-01..03 is complete with CP logs and prototype-proof artifacts; closure audits remain seeded and deferred.
- Evolution Engine work is split by layer: MVP owns Explore/Exploit, baseline anchoring, baseline genealogy, and confirmed identity/visual DNA evidence; L1 hardens observability read models; L2 enforces proof for promotion; L3 pilots governed rule promotion.
- The active product view moved to `docs/features/ui-prototyping-studio/PRODUCT-VIEW.md`; the e2e folder remains evidence-only.
- W1/W2 execution is capability-slice based: each mutation task must include backend + UI directives, targeted test checkpoints, and a prototype proof artifact.
- `docs/index/feature-map.md`, `docs/index/features-index.json`, and `docs/index/tag-index.json` are not present; links-and-feature-doc path was used for deterministic planning.
- Revalidate planner gate before any mutation-capable stage.
