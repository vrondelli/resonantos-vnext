# UI Prototyping Studio Architecture

This architecture bundle follows the Arcanum `invoke design` six-view contract for the UI Prototyping Studio Evolution Engine.

Use this file as the system-level architecture summary. Use [EVOLUTION-ARCHITECTURE.md](EVOLUTION-ARCHITECTURE.md) for the detailed internals of the evolution loop, baseline genealogy, proof gates, and self-improvement layering.

## 1. Context View

UI Prototyping Studio sits between product ideation and formal UI implementation.

The feature receives interface intent, generates bounded Explore/Exploit prototype populations, captures qualitative selection evidence, applies approved mutations, and exports evidence into the DomainSpec UI delivery pipeline. It is not a general autonomous design agent; it is a governed evolution workbench where each durable change must be explainable through state, gate, task, revision, or proof evidence.

### Actors

| Actor             | Responsibility                                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Designer          | Provides prompt intent, compares variants, selects baseline lineage |
| Reviewer          | Captures element-level comments and qualitative fitness signals     |
| PM / Lead         | Reviews synthesized mutation batches and approves apply             |
| Engineer          | Consumes revision lineage and handoff artifacts                     |
| Governance System | Enforces proof obligations and blocks unsafe self-improvement       |

### Environmental Constraints

| Constraint                                 | Architectural Effect                                          |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `variantCount` bounded to `1..3`           | Population size is deliberately small and comparable          |
| Manual gates remain mandatory              | Auto-apply and auto-promotion are forbidden                   |
| HTML-first MVP output                      | Prototype phenotype is auditable and portable                 |
| DomainSpec aspect docs are source of truth | Architecture concepts must link to formal aspects             |
| Arcanum layering governs implementation    | Evolution/proof capabilities promote only with layer evidence |

```

The MVP uses the existing studio iteration loop to prove accountable Explore/Exploit evolution: bounded population, baseline selection, identity/DNA confirmation, mutation, and lineage. The proof layer blocks self-improvement until future implementation layers supply proof pass and governance approval; it does not block normal MVP apply.

## Evolution Engine

The full engine internals are specified in [EVOLUTION-ARCHITECTURE.md](EVOLUTION-ARCHITECTURE.md#evolution-engine). This summary architecture owns the subsystem boundaries; the detailed evolution architecture owns layer-specific runtime obligations. Existing formal IDs may retain `GodelDarwin` or `GodelProof` compatibility names.

| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Population size       | Session user + system validation                          | Must be `1..3`, default `3`                                    |
| Baseline lineage      | Human for multi-variant, system commit for single-variant | Multi-option selection is mandatory                            |
| Fitness meaning       | Human/test/governance source                              | Signals are recorded as evidence, not automatic ranking in MVP |
| Mutation apply        | Human approver + server gate                              | Draft must be approved and non-stale                           |
| Rule self-improvement | Governance system + future owner                          | MVP defers; post-MVP requires proof pass and non-auto actor    |
| Handoff readiness     | System                                                    | Revision evidence and downstream references must exist         |

## 6. Dependency Interface View

| Interface                       | Direction           | Contract                                                                   |

| `NewspaperContractAdapter`      | internal adapter    | Contract-shape reuse only; no runtime import                               |
| `GodelDarwinEvolutionAdapter`   | internal adapter    | Genome, fitness, proof, and rule-promotion request boundary                |

## Risks And Mitigations

| Risk                                    | Mitigation                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Evolution metaphor becomes vague        | Keep every concept mapped to DomainSpec entities, operations, policies, and tests |
| Self-improvement bypasses governance    | MVP defers promotion; proof gate requires pass, approval, and non-auto actor      |
| Fitness signals become hidden ranking   | MVP records qualitative signals only; scoring model remains open decision         |
| Architecture drifts from implementation | Implementation layering owns promotion evidence before runtime expansion          |
